                        <h3>The Project</h3>
                        <p>Design a health and wellness app as part of CareerFoundry's UX Design course</p>

                        <h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
                        <p>An app that allows health-conscious individuals to access and track their health information through an online portal. Or an app that helps health-conscious individuals access both physical and mental health promotion content.</p>

                <h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>To gain a comprehensive understanding of the existing apps in the market, I conducted an in-depth examination of various health applications. Subsequently, I performed a competitive analysis focusing on ZocDoc and HealthTap, both of which bear similarities to HealthGuru.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>ZocDoc</h3>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>S:The app provides users the ability to choose new providers within their insurance network and the ability to track these appointments in an organized and easy-to-use format </li>
                        <li>W:The app only focuses on doctor visits and does not include any other aspects of the user's health (ie. wellness or fitness) </li>
                        <li>O:My product will give users the chance to track appointments and also engage with other parts of their health journey including their fitness and mental wellbeing. </li>
                        <li>T:Both Amino Health and Better Doctor offer on-demand booking for patients looking to find healthcare providers. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>HealthTap</h3>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>S:The app provides a convenient and straightforward way for patients to access their health information online. Users can track their appointment and their health goals while also having access to expert advice from doctors. </li>
                        <li>W:Insurance does not cover the “prime” plan. The goal tracking is very rigid. There are set goals and actions to complete with no flexibility. If the goal is to go on a walk for example and the user goes on a bike ride it technically does not count toward the goal.</li>
                        <li>O:In my own design I could look at ways to improve the flexibility of these goals. </li>
                        <li>T:Spruce Health advertises itself as the 'all in one healthcare communication' app allowing users fast and easy communication with their providers by secure messaging, phone, video, and more. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div><!--Section 4-->
                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>Offer a competitive application that allows patients to track all of their health and wellness related information. There are few applications that provide all of the users health info at a glance and so our biggest challenge is usability. we must deliver an intuitive, well organized product that allows users to track their information. Marketing will be important as it shows our users the convenience of the features that we offer.</p>
            </div>
            <div><!--Section 5-->
                <h2>Getting to Know the User</h2>
                <p>For my initial user interviews I wanted to explore the landscape of health apps and understand what users valued in them. I set out to investigate several key aspects: how people integrated health apps into their lives, the pain points they encountered with existing solutions, and the specific features they found appealing.
                    To delve into these aspects, I formulated a set of questions and gathered initial data from potential users of the HealthGuru app. I then took part in an affinity mapping exercise that allowed me to identify common themes, questions, and comments. Through this analysis, I gained valuable insights into the recurring patterns and behaviors of patients in their interactions related to health.</p>

                    </picture>
                    <p>This data laid the foundation for creating two distinct user personas, serving as valuable references as the project evolved.</p>

                <h2>User Flows</h2>
                <p>I then, began crafting user flows for various features I envisioned within the app. One such feature was the Health Calendar, which I aimed to incorporate. This calendar would empower users to schedule and manage health-related events, such as doctor appointments or dental check-ups.</p>

                <h2>Rsults of Usability Tests</h2>
                <p>I conducted several usability tests to gather feedback from potential users, as user-centric design is a top priority in this project. Through these tests, I pinpointed five key issues within my design. </p>

                <h2>Colors & Typography</h2>
                <p>In contrast to common health apps that use red for its association with health and blood, I've opted for a different approach as a health app designer. I want my users to feel welcomed and at ease when using HealthGuru. Therefore, the chosen different shades of blue, creating a calming and serene atmosphere that promotes a sense of calmness during app engagement. I've also chosen a pale yellow as an accent color.</p>

                <p>The design journey was marked by numerous iterations. While substantial progress has been made in recent months, the initial designs, though instrumental in establishing the project's groundwork, had their share of user- friendliness challenges and design flaws.</p>
